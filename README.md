<p>
My skills include C, C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, Blueprints, ImGui, LWJGL, DirectX, OpenGL, Metal, and Vulkan. Also writing shaders and visual effects, AI, UI, Gameplay, Animation, Physics, Steam, Multiplayer, Networking, Pathfinding, Lighting, Streaming, Multithreading, Debugging, Nanite, Lumen, Virtual Shadow Maps, World Partition, HLOD, Procedural Content Generation, Unreal Insights, and Entity Component Systems to name but a few. Here are some of my other skills you may find useful:
</p>

<p><strong>Unity</strong></p>
<p>
Shipped multiple titles. Worked mostly on rendering and asset pipeline optimization and procedural world-building. Most of the games I've worked on were for mobile. For example, released 3 free-to-play iOS games last year during a back-to-back-to-back game jam marathon. Currently developing a framework to accelerate this process even further.
</p>
  
<p><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></p>
<p>
Shipped multiple titles using UE4 and UE5. Worked mostly on rendering optimization and procedural world-building. Also extensively modified engine source code. For example, adding an extra render pass that attaches static and skeletal meshes (beards, eyebrows, whiskers etc) to animated skeletal meshes with morph targets using compute shaders and barycentric coordinates.
</p>

<p><strong>Custom Engines</strong></p>
<p>
Worked on multiple custom engines. For example, Bizarre Creation's own in-house used to power the Project Gotham Racing franchise. Also written numerous engines of my own over the years in various languages. My latest one is written in Java using LWJGL which I use for rapid prototyping of ideas.
</p>

<p><strong>Porting</strong></p>
<p>
Ported multiple titles.
For example, <em>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</em> using original engine from 2010 to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.
Also <em>Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories</em> to iOS and Android.
</p>

<p><strong>Houdini</strong></p>
<p>
I've been using Houdini for over five years. It's my go-to for the majority of my procedural content generation. For example, modelling, heightfields, scattering, building and road kits using PDG, Python, and VEX.
</p>

<p><strong>Blender</strong></p>
<p>
I've been using Blender for over fifteen years. I've dabbled in basic modelling and texturing but spend most of my time writing Python scripts to automate numerous processes. For example, automating the process of exporting FBX files from Unreal, passing them through Blender to perform cleanup and LOD generation, then importing them into Unity - all while preserving materials and textures.
</p>

<p><strong>Cascadeur</strong></p>
<p>
I've been using Cascadeur for a little over a year. I've dabbled in basic animating but spend most of the time writing Python scripts to automate numerous processes. For example, retargeting store bought animations to a modified UE4/UE5 skeleton using AutoPhysics, Animation Retargeting, and Animation Unbaking.
</p>

<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>
<p>
I do the majority of my scripting in Python. Automating numerous jobs in Blender, Houdini, Photoshop, Cascadeur, Unity and Unreal Engine. I also have a plethora of custom scripts to handle version control, build automation, asset validation, and continuous integration.
</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>
I'm currently looking for work, be it contract, part-time, or full-time.

Many thanks, Lloyd.
